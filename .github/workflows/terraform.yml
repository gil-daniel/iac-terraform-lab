# Terraform CI Workflow for GitHub Actions
# ----------------------------------------
# This workflow:
# - Authenticates securely with Azure using a Service Principal stored as a GitHub secret
# - Formats, validates, and plans Terraform infrastructure
# - Allows manual approval to apply changes via workflow_dispatch
#
# ⚠️ Security Note:
# The file `creds.json` is created temporarily inside the GitHub Actions runner.
# It is never committed to the repository, stored as an artifact, or exposed publicly.
# The runner is ephemeral and destroyed after the job completes.
