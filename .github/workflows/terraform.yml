# Terraform CI Workflow for GitHub Actions
# ----------------------------------------
# This workflow:
# - Authenticates securely with Azure using a Service Principal stored as a GitHub secret
# - Formats, validates, and plans Terraform infrastructure
# - Allows manual approval to apply changes via workflow_dispatch
#
# ⚠️ Security Note:
# The Azure login step uses the official GitHub Action and does NOT expose credentials.
# The runner is ephemeral and destroyed after the job completes.
